# Yazanaki Client

The launcher for the Yazanaki Empire.

## Download

**[Download the latest version](https://github.com/Yazanaki/YZNKI-Client-Releases/releases/latest)** (Windows)

1. On that page, click **Yazanaki-Client-Setup-….exe** under *Assets*.
2. Double-click the file you downloaded.
3. If Windows says "Windows protected your PC", click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
   This shows up because the installer isn't code-signed yet.

The client installs and opens by itself. From version 0.1.3 on it updates itself:
when a new version is out, a **Restart to update** button appears at the top.

## Publishing a new version

There are two release tracks, moved separately:

- **In-client updates** (the **Restart to update** button): installed clients
  read [`updater/latest.yml`](updater/latest.yml) on `main`.
- **The installer download**: the release marked *Latest*, which the download
  link above points at.

The client's `npm run release` (run automatically for each new version on its
`main` by `npm run release:watch`) pushes a branch `release-<version>` with
`Yazanaki-Client-Setup-<version>.exe`, its `.blockmap` and `latest.yml` in
`installer/`. The *Stage release* workflow then creates release `v<version>`
with them (not marked Latest), deletes the branch and promotes the version to
the track in the `AUTO_PROMOTE` repository variable (Settings > Secrets and
variables > Actions > Variables): `updater` when it is not set, or
`installer`, `both`, `none`.

To move a track by hand: Actions > **Promote** > Run workflow, enter the
version (empty for the newest release) and pick the track. Promoting the
installer marks that release Latest. Installed clients never downgrade, so
promoting an older version to `updater` only holds newer ones back.

Clients older than 0.3.5 don't read `updater/latest.yml` yet and follow the
Latest release, so promote 0.3.5 to `installer` (or `both`) once to bring them
onto the new updater.
